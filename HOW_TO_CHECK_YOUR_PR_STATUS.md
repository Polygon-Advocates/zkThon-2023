# Checking your PR status

## For contributors 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻🧑‍💻

1️⃣ | If you have **done** tag it means that the reviewers asked for few changes. Please read the README files properly to understand what is required.
Also, look at the comments by the reviewers.

2️⃣ | If you have **approved** tag it means that your PR got approved. If you want to check what challenges are approved, then look at the following tags after **approved** tag.

3️⃣ | If you have **completed but waiting approval** tag, it means that your challenges are reviewed and approved by atleast one reviewer. 

4️⃣ | If you have **completed and approved** tag you are done and approved. 

## For reviewers
