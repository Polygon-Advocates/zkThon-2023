- (1/7)  Are you familiar with Polygon's zkEVM? In order to allow privacy, scalability, and security on Ethereum, a new version of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is being developed.

- (2/7)  ZkEVM, a version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to make Ethereum more secure, scalable, and private. A modified form of the Ethereum Virtual Machine powers it. (EVM). #zkThon  #zkEVM

- (3/7)  ZkEVM enables developers to build smart contracts and interact with them without disclosing the inner workings of the transactions. As a result, users' anonymity is safeguarded and they can have confidence that financial transactions are safe.

- (4/7)  Scalability is another feature of zkEVM, which enables faster processing of more operations. To accomplish this, zk-SNARKs are used to confirm the accuracy of transactions without disclosing their fundamental details. #zkThon  #zkEVM

- (5/7) By enabling programmers to create safe smart contracts on Ethereum, zkEVM also offers security. To achieve this without jeopardizing user anonymity, zero-knowledge proofs are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the smart contract code.

- (6/7) Developers can design and work with safe, extensible, privacy-preserving smart contracts using zkEVM. Because their data is safe and their transactions are private, this enables developers to create applications on Ethereum with confidence.

- (7/7) zkEVM is a ground-breaking technology that is revolutionizing how Ethereum apps are created. It offers customers trustless computing, scalability, and secure, private transactions.
