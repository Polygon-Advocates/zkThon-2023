# 🪴 Challenge II: Deploy an ERC20 or ERC721 Token on the zkEVM Testnet


## Description: 
Deploy an ERC20 or ERC721 token on the [zkEVM Testnet](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop/). This challenge is easy and may take a few hours to complete. 

## Rewards:
Enter Lens allowlist, and claim a [**Lens**](https://www.lens.xyz/) handle.

## Get Started 🏃🏻‍♂️ 

- Setup your testnet environment for zkEVM development [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#connecting-to-zkevm).

- Claim some tokens required to work with Polygon zkEVM testnet [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop#bridge-assets-to-zkevm) 

- Write a simple ERC20 or ERC721 token smart contract using Solidity, Or for more ease of use you can use the [Openzeppelin wizard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard).

- Now let's compile and deploy your smart contract using solidity compilers like [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) on the Polygon zkEVM testnet. (NOTE: You can use Hardhat if you want to as well)

- Getting stuck mid-way with deployments? Refer to our [zkEVM wiki](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/zkEVM/develop). 

- Once deployed head over to the [block explorer](https://explorer.internal.zkevm-test.net/) and let's verify the deployment and get all the necessary information for the submission.

- We'll need two things for the submission `Transaction hash` and `Contract address`

**Example:**

```bash
# Contract Address
https://explorer.public.zkevm-test.net/address/0xYourContractAddress/contracts

# Transaction Address
https://explorer.public.zkevm-test.net/tx/0xYouTransactionAddress
```


## Challenge Submission and guidelines

- [ ] Fork the repository [ we hope you did that already 💫] 

- [ ] Create a new branch (if not already created)  `username_zkthon`, e.g.  `PriyathamVarma_zkThon` [ we hope you already did this too  💫] 

- [ ] Now let's create a file named as `solution-2.md`.

- [ ] Now let's add the code for the smart contract deployed on Polygon zkEVM Testnet in `solutions-2.md`

- [ ] **[VERY IMPORTANT STEP]** Take the `Transaction Hash` and `Contract Address` and put it the Airtable form below with rest of the details.
